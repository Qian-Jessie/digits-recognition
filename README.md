Build a convolutional neural network in Python

Train a classifier for handwritten digits on MNIST dataset.

The steps for building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's) using Keras:

- Set up environment.
- Install Keras.
- Import libraries and modules.
- Load image data from MNIST.
- Preprocess input data for Keras.
- Preprocess class labels for Keras.
- Define model architecture.
- Compile model.
- Fit model on training data.
- Evaluate model on test data.
